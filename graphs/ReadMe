Readme for Graphs, by Kevin Horton

The graphs are created with gnuplot.

http://www.gnuplot.info/

Each graph has its own file with the info required to produce that
graph.  A single graph is created by running gnuplot on that file, e.g.
"gnuplot cruise_speed.gp" will create the cruise_speed.tex and
cruise_speed.eps files.  The cruise_speed.tex file is included in the
main document - it calls the cruise_speed.eps file.

gnuplot is run on the file all.gp to produce all graphs at once.  e.g.

"gnuplot all.gp"

The file common_commands.gp has info that affects all graphs in the
Performance section.  It allows formating changes to be made to all
graphs by editing a single file.

If pdflatex is used, rather than latex, then the graphics files must
be in pdf format.  The eps files can be converted to pdf using epstopdf.
The following batch script (~/bin/epstopdf_batch.sh) will work:


#!/bin/bash
# convert eps to pdf

LIST="$(ls *.eps)"
for i in "$LIST"; do
    epstopdf "$i";
done
