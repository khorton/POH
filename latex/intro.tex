\section{INTRODUCTION} This Pilot's Operating Handbook contains nine sections with all the information required to operate the aircraft. 

\textcolor{red}{Items in red text are preliminary, and are subject to change pending the results of ground and flight tests.}

Section 1 provides basic data and information of general interest. It contains definitions or explanations of abbreviations and terminology commonly used.

This aircraft is certificated in the Amateur-Built category. The regulations governing the Amateur-Built category contain only very limited performance requirements, and no flight characteristics requirements. By virtue of its amateur-built status, all persons entering this aircraft do so at their own risk.
