\section{AMPLIFIED PROCEDURES}

\subsection{PREFLIGHT INSPECTION}
The following items should receive particular emphasis during the preflight inspection.

\textbf{Propeller} --- Check the amount of free play in the propeller blades, moving the blade tips in the plane of rotation. 1/8\char`\"{} of free play is acceptable. 2 degrees of blade rotation angle free play is acceptable. Check that the stainless steel erosion strips on the outer portion of the blade leading edges is secure. The inner PU-strip self-adhesive shield may be missing, but should be replaced within 10 hours.

Check the fibreglass blade covers for cracks. Cracks along the leading edge and at the edge of the erosion shield are acceptable, as long as the erosion shield is not loose. Cracks in the painted surface are acceptable, as long as no moisture can enter the wooden blade core. Blisters or delaminations up to one square inch are acceptable. Cracks in the stainless steel erosion shield require immediate repair.

\textbf{Fuel Tank Vents} --- The fuel vent plugs are easily missed, as the fuel vents are below the forward fuselage. Ensure that they are removed.

\textbf{Flaps}
\begin{Note}[CAUTION]
With the flaps fully extended, there is a risk that someone standing behind the wing could press on flap trailing edge, and force the flaps to move far enough that the forward edge of the upper flap skin could move aft of the aft edge of the upper wing skin. If this condition is not detected significant flap and/or upper wing skin damage may occur when the flaps are retracted. During the preflight inspection, carefully inspect the transition between the upper wing skin and the flaps to confirm that the forward edge of the upper flap skin has not come out from under the aft edge of the upper wing skin. When boarding the aircraft after the preflight inspection, be careful not to push forward on the trailing edge of the flap. 

The risk of forcing the flaps far enough to trigger this issue is mitigated by slightly retracting the flaps after landing.
\end{Note}


\textbf{Tires} --- The tires are almost completely hidden beneath the wheel pants, so it can be difficult to see if the tire pressure is low. Carefully check the clearance between the tire sidewalls and the wheel pant openings.

\textbf{Pitot-Static System} --- Ensure that the pitot cover is removed from the pitot tube, which is hidden beneath the left wing. The static system hose connected to the alternate static valve is easily knocked loose (mounted on the side of the right landing gear box in the cockpit). Check it for security, and be careful not to knock that area with the feet.

\subsection{COCKPIT ENTRY AND EGRESS}
\textbf{Front Seat Entry} --- Stand on the left wing walk area. 
% Place a towel on the front seat cushion. Place the right foot on the seat cushion. 
Place the right foot on the gold coloured wing spar centre section to the right of the front seat cushion. Support the weight of the upper body by placing the hands on the sides of the cockpit, or on the tubular structure behind the front seat back. Place the left foot on the cockpit floor ahead of the seat cushion.

\textbf{Rear Seat Entry} --- Stand on the left wing walk area. Place a towel on the rear seat cushion. Hang onto the tubular framework just behind the front seat back. Place the right foot on the seat cushion. Place the left foot on the floor ahead of the seat. Place the left hand on the canopy rail. Place the right foot on the floor ahead of the seat. Sit down.

\begin{Note}[CAUTIONS]
  \textbf{Flaps} --- Extend the flaps 90\% for cockpit entry and egress, to ensure that the flaps are not stepped upon.
  
  \textbf{Front Seat} --- Do not use the edge of the windscreen as a handhold when entering or exiting the cockpit. The windscreen fairing that extends past the edge of the
windscreen may be damaged if it is subjected to too much force. Be careful to not kick the intercom system volume knobs on the lower edge of the instrument panel with the feet. Be careful to not kick the alternate static valve on the inboard side of the right landing gear box.

  \textbf{Rear Seat} --- Warn all passengers to be careful not to lean back against the sliding canopy when they enter or leave the aircraft.
  \end{Note}
  
\subsection{STARTING ENGINE}
%follow paragraphs slavishly lifted from the Cessna 177RG POH, as it has a similar engine model.
In cold weather, the engine compartment temperature falls rapidly following engine shutdown, and the injector nozzle lines remain nearly full of fuel. Cold weather starting procedures are therefore relatively simple, with highly predictable results. However, in extremely hot weather, engine compartment temperatures increase rapidly following engine shutdown, and fuel in the lines will vapourize and escape into the intake manifold.

Hot weather starting procedures depend considerably on how soon the next engine start is attempted. Within the first \textcolor{red}{20 to 30 minutes} after shutdown, the fuel manifold is adequately primed, and the empty injector nozzle lines will fill before the engine dies. However, after approximately \textcolor{red}{30 minutes}, the vapourized fuel in the manifold will have nearly dissipated, and some slight ``priming'' could be required to refill the nozzle lines and keep the engine running after the initial start. Starting a hot engine is facilitated by advancing the mixture control promptly to one third open when the engine fires, and then smoothly to full rich as power develops.

Should the engine tend to die after starting, temporarily select the boost pump ON and adjust throttle as necessary to keep the engine running.

In the event of over-priming or flooding, select the boost pump OFF, open the throttle from one half to full open, and continue cranking with the mixture at CUT-OFF. When the engine fires, smoothly advance the mixture control to FULL RICH and retard the throttle to the desired idle speed.

If the engine is under-primed (most likely in cold weather with a cold engine) it will not fire at all, and additional priming will be necessary.

After starting, if the oil pressure gauge does not begin to show oil pressure within 30 seconds in the summertime, and 60 seconds in very cold weather, stop the engine and investigate.

\begin{Note}
  Additional details concerning cold weather starting and operation may be found under COLD WEATHER OPERATION
  paragraphs in this section.
  \end{Note}

\subsection{TAXIING}
\subsubsection{AUTOPILOT}
\textbf{Pre-Flight Test} --- A preflight override and disengagement test should be conducted if the autopilot is to be used in IMC or at night. 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item WING LVLR --- ON (Right Console)
%  \item TURN knob --- Centre
  \item Autopilot --- ON
  \item H~NAV and V~NAV --- Engage
  % \item TK$\bullet$TC$\bullet$WL Switch --- WL. Engages Wing-Leveler mode.
  % \item Make left and right turns during taxi --- Stick should move against the turn.
  \item Controls --- Override. Confirm that the autopilot servo clutches will slip to allow the stick to be moved in both axis when the autopilot is engaged.
  \item Trim/Wing-Leveler Disconnect Switch on control stick --- Press and Release. Confirm both servos release while disconnect switch is pressed. Release the Disconnect switch.
  % \item TK$\bullet$TC$\bullet$WL Switch --- TC. Selects Turn Coordinator mode, disengaging the wing-leveler servo from the flight controls.
  \end{enumerate}

\needspace{15\baselineskip}
  \subsubsection{CONTROL USE DURING TAXIING}
When taxiing, it is important that aileron and elevator be used as appropriate to the wind direction (see Figure \ref{taxi-diagram}. Taxiing over loose gravel should only be done at low engine speed to avoid abrasion and stone damage to propeller tips.

  \end{figure}

\subsection{BEFORE TAKEOFF}
  \subsubsection{WARM-UP}
  Since the engine is closely cowled, care should be taken to avoid over-heating during prolonged engine operation on the ground. Long periods of idling at low RPM may caused fouled spark plugs. It is advisable to lean aggressively while at low power on the ground. If the mixture is leaned, it must be leaned far enough that the engine would run noticeably rough during the higher power setting of the ignition check.
  
  \subsubsection{IGNITION CHECK}
  The ignition check should be done at 1800 RPM as follow:
  \ifthenelse{\thePMAG = 0}{
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Select the IGNITION, MAG switch to OFF. There should be no RPM drop, as the electronic ignition is more advanced than the magneto at this condition, so the spark from the magneto contributes little. The engine should run smoothly on the electronic ignition.
  \item Select the IGNITION, MAG switch to ON.
  \item Select the IGNITION, ELEC switch to OFF. The RPM drop should be approximately 100 RPM, and the engine should run smoothly on the magneto. 
  \item Select the IGNITION, ELEC switch to ON.
  \end{enumerate}
  }{
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Select the IGNITION, MAG switch to OFF. There should be approximately 20 rpm drop. The engine should run smoothly on the Light Speed electronic ignition.
  \item Select the IGNITION, MAG switch to ON.
  \item Select the IGNITION, ELEC switch to OFF. The RPM drop should be approximately 70 RPM, and the engine should run smoothly on the PMag electronic ignition. 
  \item Pull the PMag CB, to force the PMag to rely on its own internal alternator to provide ignition power, confirming proper operation on this power source.
  \item Reset the PMag CB.
  \item Select the IGNITION, ELEC switch to ON.
  \end{enumerate}
  }
  
  \subsubsection{ELECTRICAL SYSTEM CHECK}
  The following should be conducted prior to night or IFR flight:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Select ESS BUS FEED switch to EMER.
    \item Select BATT/ALT switch to OFF. The low voltage condition should cause the``ENGINE MONT.'' light to flash, and the EIS 4000 should switch to a page showing the voltage. The GNS 430W should still be operating, indicating that the Essential Bus is powered.
    \item Select STBY ALT switch to ON. 
    \item Increase engine speed to 1800 rpm.
    \item Check the Voltage --- it should be approximately 12.8 volts, indicating that the standby alternator is operative.
    \item Select STBY ALT switch to OFF
    \item Select BATT/ALT switch to BATT + ALT
    \item Select ESS BUS FEED switch to NORM.
    \end{enumerate}
  
\subsection{STABILITY AND CONTROL}
  \subsubsection{STATIC LONGITUDINAL STABILITY}
  The aircraft has an unusually large range between the forward and aft CG limits, which leads to substantial differences in stability and control characteristics between forward and aft CG loadings. At forward CG, the stick forces are relatively high, and the aircraft has strong static longitudinal stability. The stick forces required for a given manoeuvre decrease significantly as the CG moves aft, and the static longitudinal stability becomes much weaker. 
  
The low speed, power off, stick free static longitudinal stability is neutral to slightly negative at the aerobatic aft CG limit. If the aircraft is trimmed at a particular speed, and the speed is changed, the aircraft has no natural tendency to return to the trimmed speed. 
 
The stick free static longitudinal stability is degraded as engine power is increased, and becomes noticeably negative at high power at low speed at aft CG. If the aircraft is trimmed for a climb speed, and the speed is reduced, a push force is needed to stabilize at a lower speed, and the speed will reduce to the stall if the stick is released. At higher speeds, as in for cruise or descent, the stick free static longitudinal stability is positive, even at aft CG and high power.
 
\begin{Note}[WARNING]
The aircraft will diverge from the trimmed speed at high power at low speed at aft CG. It will decelerate to the stall if left to its own devices. Particular attention should be paid to airspeed control during climbs in IMC conditions, or at climbs at low altitude in any weather conditions.
\end{Note}

\subsection{TAKEOFF}
  \subsubsection{POWER CHECK}
    It is important to check full-throttle engine operation early in the takeoff run. Any sign of rough engine operation or sluggish engine acceleration is good cause for rejecting the takeoff.
    
    Full throttle operation over loose gravel is especially harmful to propeller tips. When takeoffs must be made over a gravel surface, it is very important that the throttle be advanced slowly, to allow the aircraft to start rolling before high RPM is developed. The tail should be kept down longer than normal to increase the propeller ground clearance.
    
    Prior to takeoffs from airfields above \textcolor{red}{3,000} feet elevation, the mixture should be leaned to the value on the placard located ahead of the throttle quadrant.
    
  \subsubsection{FLAP SETTING}
    Normal takeoffs are performed with flaps retracted. Short field takeoffs are performed with one-third flap, which is set by deflecting the ailerons fully, and extending the flaps so that the flap angle matches the angle of the down aileron.
    
  \subsubsection{CROSSWIND TAKEOFF}
    Takeoffs have been demonstrated with crosswinds of \textcolor{red}{12} knots from the left and \textcolor{red}{8} knots from the right, with flaps retracted. 

\subsection{CLIMB}
Note the highest EGT on the bottom right corner of the EIS 4000 default display page immediately after selecting climb power following take-off. Reduce the mixture as required during climb to keep the highest EGT close to this value without exceeding it.

If there are obstacles to clear, climb at $\mathrm{V_{X}}$ (\textcolor{red}{65} KIAS at sea level and \textcolor{red}{77} KIAS at 10,000 ft). Use full throttle and 2700 RPM, with mixture adjusted to maintain the target EGT and flaps retracted.

If maximum rate of climb is needed, use the climb speed from Figure \ref{ROC-Max}, full throttle and 2700 RPM, with mixture adjusted to maintain the target EGT and flaps retracted.

Normal climbs should be made at the speed from Figure \ref{TFD-to-climb-Norm}, using full throttle and 2700 RPM.
\subsection{CRUISE}
Normal cruise power is between 55\% and 75\% power. Adjust the mixture to achieve the fuel flow given in Figure \ref{Cruise-power}. Adjust the oil cooler door to obtain an oil temperature of approximately 190\textdegree F.
\subsection{STALLS AND SPINS}

\subsubsection{STALLS} The aircraft has very little natural stall warning in wings level and 30\textdegree \ bank stalls. There is a small amount of buffet approximately one kt prior to the stall. The nose drops at the stall. A small wing drop may occur if the ball is not centred. There is a sharp left wing drop at stalls with high power settings.

There is significant, progressively increasing aerodynamic buffet prior to stalls with 2g or higher load factor.

\subsubsection{SPINS}\textcolor{red}{Complete this section following flight test. Add info on susceptibility to inadvertent spin, intentional spin entry procedure, spin recovery procedure, altitude loss during spin recovery and any relevant info on inverted spins.}

There is insufficient nose up elevator authority to keep in the aircraft in a spin at mid or forward CG with the power at idle. The angle of attack, pitch rate and roll rate are oscillatory. If pro-spin controls are held, the IAS, load factor and rotation rate increase, indicating a spiral dive. One wing may stall during one of the pitch rate oscillations, leading to a very sharp snap roll.

\begin{Note}[Caution]
If the IAS increases during a spin, recover immediately, as the aircraft is in a spiral dive. If pro-spin controls are held, the aircraft may do a violent high g snap roll which could damage the structure. 
\end{Note}

\subsection{AEROBATICS}

Refer to manoeuvring speed and weight and balance limitations when
contemplating aerobatics. The manoeuvring speed is the highest speed at
which full and abrupt control can be applied without exceeding design
loads. This is not the highest permissible aerobatic entry speed, but
control inputs must be limited to less than full at any speed above
manoeuvring speed.

The entry speeds for some manoeuvres can vary over a wide range due
to the large ratio of maximum speed to stall speed. For vertical manoeuvres
(e.g. loops, Immelmann turns and Cuban eights) entry speed has
an inverse relationship to G forces required to complete the manoeuvre.
An entry speed at lower speeds will require a higher G pull up than
for entry near top end of speed range. 

\begin{Note}[WARNING]
Excessive speed build up can occur very quickly, particularly in a
dive. The RV-8 is a pilot limited aircraft due to the light control
forces and aerodynamic cleanliness --- it is the pilot's responsibility
 to not overstress the aircraft. The stick forces vary considerably
with CG position --- stick forces at aft CG are much lighter then stick
forces at forward CG.
\end{Note}

\begin{Note}
The following list of manoeuvres are approved 
when operating at weights less than 703.1 kg (1550 lb) and with the
CG in the aerobatic envelope.

\subsection{DESCENT}
Close the oil cooler door during descent to keep the oil warm.
\begin{Note} 
Attempt to manage power and airspeed during descent to keep the CHT cooling rate no greater than 50\textdegree F/min to avoid shock cooling, preferably 30\textdegree F/min or less.
\end{Note}


\subsection{BEFORE LANDING}

\subsection{LANDING}
Landings may be made with any flap angle. Landings in strong crosswind should be made with flaps retracted. Landings have been demonstrated with winds of 20 knots from the left and 25 knots from the right, with flaps retracted. Wheel landings are preferred, but three-point landings may be made if a shorter landing distance is required.

\begin{Note}[CAUTION]
The tailwheel steering unlocks at full left rudder, which may lead to a ground loop in strong left crosswind.\end{Note}

\subsection{SHUTDOWN}
\begin{Note}[CAUTION]
With the flaps fully extended, there is a risk that someone standing behind the wing could press on the flap trailing edge, and force the flaps to move far enough that the forward edge of the upper flap skin could move aft of the aft edge of the upper wing skin. If this condition is not detected significant flap and/or upper wing skin damage may occur when the flaps are retracted. To reduce the probability of this happening, the flaps should not be left in the fully extended position on the ground. Instead, leave them approximately 90\% extended.\end{Note}

\needspace{10\baselineskip}
\subsection{COLD WEATHER OPERATION}
\subsubsection{Engine Preheat} The engine should be preheated prior to start if the temperature has been below 0\textdegree C. The Reiff preheater plug is clamped to the back of the rear baffle and can be accessed through the oil filler door. An engine blanket is required to allow the 300W preheat to increase the engine temperature to adequate levels if the temperature is -15\textdegree C or colder.

\subsubsection{Wheel Pants} The wheel pants must be removed for operations in loose snow, as snow will collect in the pants. The heat from the brakes will melt snow and the resulting water will later freeze on the brakes.

\subsection{HOT WEATHER OPERATION}
\textcolor{red}{Hot weather operations section to be added.}

\subsection{AUTOPILOT}
\subsubsection{Altimeter Setting} The autopilot does not have a means to directly enter an altimeter setting. Instead, the current altitude is entered whenever the "BARO SET" message is displayed, which allows the system to determine the needed offset to the pressure altitude sensed from the static input. The "BARO SET" message will appear following initial power up and any time a selected altitude is entered.

The autopilot will normally engage in ALT HLD mode, with the current altitude as the reference. The ALT HLD reference altitude may be adjusted by pressing the "V~MODE" button until "ALT ADJ UP/DN" is displayed, then turning the rotary knob. CW rotation increases the altitude by 5 ft/click, and CCW rotation decreases it by 5 ft/click. Alternatively, the red AP/TRIM Disconnect switch on the control stick may be pressed and held for a minimum of 5 seconds, which releases the servos and allows the pilot to manoeuvre to the desired altitude, which resets the ALT HLD reference.

\subsubsection{ALT HLD Performance} ALT HLD mode works well in straight and level flight, but up to 200 ft altitude will be lost in turns at 30\textdegree \ bank at forward CG. Performance at aft CG is much better, with 50 ft of altitude loss typically seen. The pitch servo should be disengaged and the altitude controlled manually during turns with more than 30\textdegree \ of heading change when flying IFR at forward CG. Alternatively, when following radar vectors, the red AP/TRIM Disconnect switch on the control stick may be pressed and held while the aircraft is manually manoeuvred to the new heading. The current course and altitude will be maintained once the disconnect switch is released.

\begin{Note}
  The autopilot lateral mode will switch to CRS when the red AP/TRIM Disconnect switch on the control stick is pressed and held.
\end{Note}
