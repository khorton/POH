\chapter{AIRPLANE HANDLING, SERVICE \& MAINTENANCE} \vspace{\minitocspacebefore} \minitoc \cleardoublepage

\section{INTRODUCTION} This is a place-holder for the Airplane Handling, Service \& Maintenance Section. The section will be completed once in-service experience has been gained.

\section{GROUND HANDLING}
Ground motion is best accomplished by pushing or pulling on the propeller as near to the
spinner as possible. The following are recommended additional pushing locations to help move the
airplane: 

\begin{itemize*}
  \item Moving forward --- front seat support (canopy open).
  \item Moving rearwards --- wing leading edges and roots of horizontal stabilizer.
  \end{itemize*}

A suitable pushbar may be fitted over the two ends of the tailwheel axle.

Take care to not use high power during run-up, as the tail will lift even if the control stick is held full aft.

Wing tie down mounting points are located centrally under each wing. Use a 3/8" dia x 16
tpi eye bolt to attach tie down rope to airplane. Secure a third line to the tail wheel spring.

\subsection{Canopy Protection and Ventilation}
If the aircraft is tied down outdoors and subject to weather elements for any length of time, then the use of an aircraft canopy cover is highly recommended. The cover will protect canopies and windows from abrasive dust, dirt, and sand kicked up by wind or prop wash. Before purchasing, verify that the canopy cover is NOT waterproof as the trapped moisture and heat from the sun can be deleterious. Acrylic subjected to this treatment over a period of time may turn slightly milky and eventually crazes.

Keep the canopy ventilated or covered when the aircraft is parked in the hot sun. Cabin temperatures can easily reach 150-200 degrees F even on a mild day. The acrylic can generally take these temperature conditions multiple times without any apparent adverse effect, but the cumulative affect that will cause shortened service life. The use of a canopy cover will significantly reduce the internal temperatures inside the aircraft to just a few degrees above outside ambient temperatures. Additionally it will also protect the avionics from heat and the upholstery/seat belt harnesses from harmful UV rays.

\section{SERVICING}
\subsection{Brakes}
The brake fluid reservoir is located on the engine side of the firewall near the upper left side.  The preferred brake fluid is MIL-PRF-83282, but MIL-H-5606 fluid can mixed if required.  Note that MIL-H-5606 has a much lower flash point, so should be avoided if possible.

The original O-rings in the brake calipers were replaced with Viton O-rings, due to the much higher acceptable temperature of Viton.

\section{CLEANING AND CARE}
\subsection{Windscreen and Canopy}
The windscreen and canopy are fabricated from polymethyl methacrylate) (PMMA), an acrylic plastic, brand name Plexiglas.

\subsubsection{Cleaning}
For general cleaning use Dawn dishwashing liquid or equivalent and water followed by a clear water rinse. To prevent water spots, blow dry with compressed air or wipe dry with soft cotton flannel. Plexus, Sprayaway \#848 Industrial Plastic Cleaner, or All Clear can also be used for day to day cleaning. Grease, oil, tape residue, etc. may best be removed with Mineral spirits, refined kerosene, white gasoline, naphtha, or isopropyl alcohol. Wash approved solvents off of canopy with Dawn dishwashing liquid and water. It is best to avoid using products that are not specifically formulated for acrylics (such as Rain-X or Lemon Pledge) on the canopy.

\begin{Note}[CAUTION]DO NOT use Loctite, aromatic solvents, acetone, benzene, ethyl acetate, carbon tetrachloride, lighter fluid, lacquer thinners, gasoline, toluene, window sprays, concentrated alcohols, keytones, scouring compounds, ammonia, or 409 cleaner on or around acrylic canopy materials.
\end{Note}

\subsubsection{Scratch Removal}
Small scratches can be buffed out with Meguiar's Mirror Glaze \#17. For deep scratch removal, use Scratch Off , Micro Mesh, or 3M Window Repair kits. Avoid removing scratches in critical areas where clear visibility is important, as the process will usually result in some degree of optical distortion.

\section{COWLING REMOVAL} \textcolor{red}{See C-GFEW POH for example.}

\section{INSPECTION PANELS}
In addition to the engine cowling, the aircraft has a number of inspection and access panels:
\begin{enumerate*}
  \item Oil dipstick access door on aft right side of upper cowling.
  \item Instrument panel access door on aft wall of forward baggage compartment. Four Torx T10 screws are removed, allowing the access panel to be opened.
  \item Three under-wing inspection panels on each wing provide access to fuel tank securing bolts and aileron bellcranks.
  \item Rear fuselage inspection plates on each side provide access to the elevator horns.
  \item Rear baggage compartment aft wall and hat shelf are removable, providing access to the battery and rear fuselage.
  \item Cockpit and rear baggage compartment floors are removable.
  \item Wing tips are removable, but note that they must remain close to the wing tips due to the coax connections to an internal antenna in each wing tip, and the power wires for the strobe and navigation lights in each wing tip.
  \end{enumerate*}

\begin{Note}[CAUTION]
The ADS-B must not be powered up unless an ADS-B antenna is connected to it.  If the middle right wing inspection panel is removed, and it is desired to power up the aircraft, either:
\begin{enumerate*}
	\item Remove the fuse for the ADS-B transmitter, or
	\item Uplug the wiring harness from Echo UAT ADS-B transmitter, on the bottom of the avionics shelf below the instrument panel, or
	\item Connect the ADS-B antenna to its coax.
\end{enumerate*}
\end{Note}

\section{ELT SELF-TEST}
\begin{Note}[NOTE]
  The ELT transmits on both 121.5 MHz and 406 MHz during the test.  The 406 MHz transmission is coded as a self-test, but the 121.5 MHz transmission is identical to an emergency transmission.  Thus any self-test must only be performed in the first five minutes of the hour.
  \end{Note}
The ELT Self-Test is performed as follows:
\begin{enumerate*}
	\item Battery Master Switch is OFF.
	\item ELT Switch is ARMED.
	\item Press Test/Reset Button on ELT Remote Control (right most button).
	\item ELT Remote Control Lamp should flash once.
	\item A single beep will sound if the ELT passes the self test.
	\item Two to Five beeps will sound if there is a problem:
	\begin{enumerate*}
	  \item 2 beeps, followed by 2 second delay, followed by 2 beeps: battery low.
	  \item 3 beeps, followed by 2 second delay, followed by 3 beeps: low RF power.
	  \end{enumerate*}
	\item Check for email from Canadian Beacon Registry confirming reception of the ELT signal by the satellite network.
