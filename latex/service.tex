\chapter{AIRPLANE HANDLING, SERVICE \& MAINTENANCE} \vspace{\minitocspacebefore} \minitoc \cleardoublepage

\section{INTRODUCTION} This is a place-holder for the Airplane Handling, Service \& Maintenance Section. The section will be completed once in-service experience has been gained.

\section{GROUND HANDLING}
Ground motion is best accomplished by pushing or pulling on the propeller as near to the
spinner as possible. The following are recommended aditional pushing locations to help move the
airplane: 

\begin{itemize*}
  \item Moving forward --- front seat support (canopy open).
  \item Moving rearwards --- wing leading edges and roots of horizontal stabilizer.
  \end{itemize*}

A suitable pushbar may be fitted over the two ends of the tailwheel axel.

Take care to not use high power during runup, as the tail will lift even if the control stick is held full aft.

Wing tie down mounting points are located centrally under each wing. Use a 3/8" dia x 16
tpi eyebolt to attach tie down rope to airplane. Secure a third line to the tail wheel spring.

\section{CLEANING AND CARE}

\textcolor{red}{???}

\section{COWLING REMOVAL} \textcolor{red}{See C-GFEW POH for example.}

\section{INSPECTION PANELS}
In addition to the engine cowling, the aircraft has a number of inspection and access panels:
\begin{enumerate*}
  \item Oil dipstick access door on aft right side of upper cowling.
  \item Instrument panel access door on aft wall of forward baggage compartment.  Four Torx T10 screws are removed, allowing the access panel to be opened.
  \item Three under-wing inspection panels on each wing provide access to fuel tank securing bolts and aileron bellcranks.
  \item Rear fuselage inspection plates on each side provide access to the elevator horns.
  \item Rear baggage compartment aft wall and hat shelf are removable, providing access to the battery and rear fuselage.
  \item Cockpit and rear baggage compartment floors are removable.
  \item Wing tips are removable, but note that they must remain close to the wing tips due to the coax connections to an internal antenna in each wing tip, and the power wires for the strobe and navigation lights in each wing tip.
  \end{enumerate*}
