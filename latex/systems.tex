\section{AIRFRAME}

The airframe is aluminum alloy construction except for steel components comprising: engine mount, landing gear, landing gear mounts, elevator control horns and other miscellaneous items. The tips of the wings and tail surfaces as well as cowling, landing gear fairings, empennage fairings and canopy skirt are fabricated from fibreglass. The aircraft is conventionally configured with a 13.5\% thick NACA 23000 series non-laminar-flow airfoil.

\section{COCKPIT LAYOUT}

%\textcolor{red}{Finish adding legends for instrument panel diagram.}
The flight instruments are in a ``Standard-T'' arrangement, very slightly right of centre on the main instrument panel. The engine instruments and fuel gauges are to the right side of the flight instruments, and the avionics are located to the left of the flight instruments (Figure \ref{inst-panel}). Switches that are normally only used on the ground are on a switch console on the right cockpit wall below the instrument panel (Figure \ref{right-console}). Switches that are normally used in flight are on the sub-panel to the left of the main instrument panel (Figure \ref{left-sub-panel}).

The throttle, propeller and mixture controls are in a throttle quadrant mounted on the left cockpit wall below the instrument panel. The fuel selector is on a horizontal shelf on the lower, left side of the cockpit ahead of the pilot's seat.

Engine alternate air and oil cooler door controls are mounted on the side of the left landing gear box structure, below and ahead of the instrument panel. The cockpit heat controls are mounted on the aft wall of the forward baggage compartment, below and ahead of the instrument panel to the right of the pilot's right calf. 

The parking brake control is mounted on the centre of the forward baggage compartment aft bulkhead, below and ahead of the instrument panel.

The front stick grip contains controls for pitch and roll trim, trim and autopilot cut-out, boost pump ON-OFF toggle, radio transmit, and starter engage (Figure \ref{stick-grip}).

The auxiliary power outlet is located on the lower aft face of the right landing gear box structure.

The rear seat has a throttle mounted on the left side wall, and a pitch trim switch just ahead of the throttle. There is a radio transmit push-button near the top of the bulkhead on the right side of the rear cockpit. \clearpage \vspace*{\fill}

\section{CANOPY}

\textbf{Canopy Latch} --- The canopy is latched by a handle and hook at the left front side of the sliding canopy frame. The handle may rotate and the hook may release if the handle is hit in flight, but the air loads push the canopy forward, so there is no risk of it departing the aircraft.

\textbf{Canopy Jettison} --- The front canopy bow is attached to the rollers by ``Pip'' pins that can be pulled by the pilot, thus allowing the front of the canopy to be released from the rails. The canopy jettison procedure is:
\begin{enumerate*}
	\item Canopy ``Pip'' pins --- PULL 
	\item Canopy Latch --- UNLATCH 
	\item Canopy --- PULL AFT and PUSH UP 
	\item Head --- DUCK to prevent getting hit by canopy as it departs the aircraft 
\end{enumerate*}
\begin{Note}
	[WARNING] The canopy may hit the tail as it departs the aircraft, so the canopy should only be jettisoned if it is intended to abandon the aircraft. 
\end{Note}

\needspace{10\baselineskip}
\section{ENGINE AND PROPELLER}

The aircraft is powered by a Lycoming I0-360-A1B6 four cylinder, direct drive, horizontally opposed engine rated at 200 HP at 2700 rpm. The engine is fitted with a 60 amp 14 volt main alternator, an 8 amp standby alternator, 
\ifthenelse{\thePMAG = 1}{PMag electronic ignition,}
{shielded magneto ignition,}
 Light Speed Engineering electronic ignition, fuel pump, fuel injection, and an alternate air induction system. 
 
\ifthenelse{\thePMAG = 1}
{The PMag has two power sources. It is powered from the Essential Bus during start and at ground idle. It is powered by its own internal alternator if the rpm is above approximately 875 rpm, and will thus provide ignition even after a total electrical failure. The PMag internal alternator may be checked by pulling the PMAG BU PWR CB, which removes the Essential Bus power.}
{The magneto is self-powered, and will provide ignition even after a total electrical failure.} 
The Light Speed Electronic ignition is powered from the Battery Bus, and will provide ignition as long as there is sufficient battery voltage available.

The exhaust system is all stainless steel with a crossover configuration and no mufflers. Two heat muffs provide cabin heat.

The engine drives a 72.05\char`\"{} (183 cm) diameter MT three-blade constant speed propeller. The propeller blade roots have counterweights that force them towards coarse pitch if propeller governor oil pressure is lost. The propeller blades are of composite construction, with a wooden core covered by epoxy fibreglass. The outer portion of the blade leading edges is protected by a stainless steel erosion strip that is bonded in place. The inner portion of the blade leading edge is protected by a self-adhesive strip.

\section{ENGINE MONITOR} 
\begin{wrapfigure}[15]{R}{0pt}
	
	\includegraphics{../Diagrams/eis1} \caption{EIS 4000 Engine Monitor} 
\end{wrapfigure}

The Grand Rapids EIS 4000 Engine Information System (EIS) is located on the lower right side of the main instrument panel, and is powered from the Essential Bus, through the ``ENG INST'' switch on the right switch panel. The EIS 4000 displays the following engine parametres:
\begin{itemize*}
	\item RPM 
	\item Manifold Pressure (in HG) 
	\item Oil Temperature (\textdegree F) 
	\item Oil Pressure (\textdegree F) 
	\item Cylinder Head Temperature --- all cylinders (\textdegree F) 
	\item Exhaust Gas Temperatures --- all cylinders (\textdegree F) 
	\item Fuel Flow (USG/hr) 
	\item Fuel Remaining (USG) 
	\item Fuel Pressure ($\mathrm{lb/in^{2}}$) 
	\item Essential Bus Voltage (v)
	\item Outside Air Temperature (\textdegree F) from sensor mounted in NACA scoop under right wing. 
\end{itemize*}

\subsection*{Alarms}

%\textbf{Alarms} --- Each parametre that the EIS monitors can have upper and lower limits assigned, and the EIS will annunciate an alarm condition if these limits are breached.
Each parametre that the EIS monitors can have upper and lower limits assigned, and the EIS will annunciate an alarm condition if these limits are breached. The ``MSTR WARN'' red light will flash (upper left side of instrument panel), and the EIS display will change pages to show the affected parametre flashing above its label. If the parametre returns within the allowable range, the ``MSTR WARN'' light will extinguish, and the display will automatically return to the previously displayed page. The alarm can be reset by pressing the ``Next/Ack'' on the EIS. The ``MSTR WARN'' light will stop flashing, but will remain illuminated as long as any parametre remains outside the allowable range. The display will change to the previously displayed page.

\subsection*{Display Formats}

%\textbf{Displays} --- There are 14 different pages of data that may be displayed. 
There are 14 different pages of data that may be displayed. Pressing the ``Next/Ack'' button cycles to the next page. Pressing the ``Previous'' button cycles to the previous page. Double-pushing the ``Display'' button changes to the default page. The two user-configurable pages don't have labels identifying which parametre each block of numbers represents. Pressing and holding the ``Display'' button from a user-configurable page replaces the digits with the data labels, allowing the data blocks to be identified.

\subsection*{Setting Alarm Limits}
The upper and lower alarm limits, and other user-modifiable data, may be edited via the ``Set Limits'' function, accessed by pressing and holding the ``Next/Ack'' and `` Previous'' buttons. This brings up a long series of pages where individual parametres may be adjusted, using ``soft'' labels above each of the EIS keys. After the desired parametres are modified, normal operation is resumed by pressing and holding the ``Display'' button (which will have a soft label of ``Next'') to quickly scroll through the pages until the final page is reached, or by cycling the EIS power OFF then ON, via the ENG INST switch on the right console.

\subsection*{Normal Operation}

After power-up, the EIS will alarm for any parametres that are outside the allowable limits, such as oil pressure, fuel pressure, etc. Acknowledge each alarm in turn by a momentary press of the ``Next/Ack'' button. The unit will default to the User-Configurable Page 1, which has RPM, MP, highest CHT and EGT, Oil Pressure, Oil Temperature and Fuel Flow. Pressing and holding the ``Display'' button will replace the data with the data labels, so each field may be identified. A press of the ``Next/Ack'' button will bring up User-Configurable Page 2, which has Fuel Quantity, Fuel Flow, Fuel Pressure, OAT, Voltage and Main Alternator Load. There are 14 different pages in all --- a double-push of the ``Display'' button will return to the default page.

\textbf{Fuel Detotalizer} --- Upon power-up the fuel detotalizer function will start with the fuel quantity it had at the last power-down. Press and hold the left and right buttons to reach the fuel quantity page. Once on the fuel quantity page, the fuel quantity may be adjusted as indicated by the ``Soft'' labels. The fuel quantity can be quickly set to 43 USG (full tanks) by simultaneously pushing the buttons indicated by the ``Inc'' and ``Dec'' labels.

\textbf{Digital Leaning Page} --- The digital leaning page is a special page that is intended to be used when leaning the mixture. This page is identified by the ``L'' in the lower right corner. Initially it shows the highest EGT for each cylinder, until each cylinder's EGT peaks, in which case it shows the EGT decrease from peak. The first cylinder to peak is identified by the digit in the top right corner of the window. Note that the numbering scheme here is not the same as Lycoming's cylinder numbering scheme --- 1 is top left (Cyl \#2), 2 is top right (Cyl \#1), 3 is bottom left (Cyl \#4) and 4 is bottom right (Cyl \#3).

The page is used as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Select the Digital Lean Page, identified by the ``L'' in the lower right corner.
\item Select the ``Save Lean Point?'' window, by a momentary press of the centre and right buttons, and select ``RESET''. This resets the highest EGTs to the current values.
\item Slowly lean the engine. The EGTs should all increase, and the highest EGT for each cylinder will be continually updated.
\item As leaning continues, one cylinder will reach peak EGT. Once the EGT was decreased by 10\textdegree F below peak the display will change to now show the number of degrees that the cylinder is less than the peak EGT. The first cylinder to peak is identified by the digit in the top right corner of the window. Note that the numbering scheme here is not the same as Lycoming's cylinder numbering scheme --- 1 is top left (Cyl \#2), 2 is top right (Cyl \#1), 3 is bottom left (Cyl \#4) and 4 is bottom right (Cyl \#3).
\item Enrichen or lean as desired so all cylinders are at the desired value lower than the peak EGT.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Abnormal Operations} The EIS will flash the ``MSTR WARN'' red light if any parametre goes outside the upper or lower limits programmed via the ``Set Limits'' interface. The EIS display will automatically change to a page that displays the parametre of interest, with the value flashing. Press the ``Next/Ack'' button to acknowledge the warning --- the EIS display will return to its previous page. The ``MSTR WARN'' light will stop flashing, but will remain illuminated until all parametres are within the programmed ranges. If another parametre goes outside the programmed ranges, the ``MSTR WARN'' light will flash again, and the display will change to show the parametre of interest.

\section{ENGINE CONTROLS} Engine controls consist of throttle, propeller, mixture, alternate air door and oil cooler door controls. The throttle, propeller and mixture controls are in a throttle quadrant mounted on the left side of the front cockpit. The alternate air door position is controlled by a push-pull Bowden cable connected to a knob mounted on the upper, inboard side of the left landing gear box structure, underneath and ahead of the instrument panel. The oil cooler door controls the amount of air that enters the oil cooler, to allow the oil temperature to be varied. The oil cooler door position is controlled by a push-pull Bowden cable connected to a knob mounted on the upper, inboard side of the left landing gear box structure, underneath and ahead of the instrument panel.

\section{LANDING GEAR} The landing gear is of conventional configuration with steel landing gear legs. The tail wheel is full castering --- it is normally locked and follows the rudder position, but unlocks to a castering condition if full left rudder is applied, or full right rudder combined with right brake.

\begin{Note}[CAUTION]
The tailwheel steering unlocks at full left rudder, which may lead to a ground loop in strong left crosswind.\end{Note}

The main gear wheels are fitted with Cleveland 199-102 wheels and disk brakes. The tail wheel is solid rubber.

\section{BRAKES} The braking system consists of toe brakes attached to the rudder pedals operating two Cleveland brake master cylinders. The left and right brake master cylinders share a common fluid reservoir installed on the top left front face of the fire wall. Care must be taken to avoid applying brake pressure when using rudder on the ground.

%Both brake pedals should have a similar feel and a firm resistance
%after \textcolor{yellow}{\_}\char`\"{} of pedal travel.
The parking brake control valve is mounted on the forward baggage compartment aft bulkhead, below and forward of the instrument panel. The valve cannot be seen with the head in the normal flying position, but it can be felt if the hand is placed below the instrument panel, and it can be seen if the head is lowered. The control lever is on the left side of the braking brake valve, and has a spring loaded catch to secure it in the OFF position. The parking brake is OFF if the control lever is rotated vertically upwards, and it is ON if the control lever is rotated vertically downwards.
\begin{Note}
[WARNING] The parking brake valve must be checked prior to landing to ensure that it is held in the OFF position by the spring-loaded catch. If the parking brake valve is in the ON position, any applied brake cannot be released, which may lead to loss of directional control.
\end{Note}
\begin{Note}
[WARNING] The brakes have enough brake energy capacity for a single maximum braked rejected take-off or landing from normal approach speed. Multiple hard braking events, or a maximum braked landing from an abnormally high landing speed could overheat the brakes resulting in brake failure.
\end{Note}

\textcolor{red}{ADD PHOTO OR DRAWING OF PARKING BRAKE VALVE LOCATION}

\section{FLIGHT CONTROLS}

%Flight control integrity is essential for safe flight. At installation
%or after maintenance it should be confirmed that ALL controls are
%connected, secured and safeties and that they all operate within the
%specified ranges smoothly and in the correct direction. Full travel
%should be confirmed prior to each flight. NO play should be permitted
%in the control hinges; sloppiness may induce flutter. Similarly trim
%tabs must be free of play.
%
Dual controls are fitted. A pin at the base of the passenger control stick allows it to be removed without affecting the operation of the remaining controls. Elevator and ailerons are operated through a system of adjustable push rods. The rudder is operated through a cable system to the rudder pedals.
%Rudder control from the rear seat position is by pads connected to push rods that are connected to the rudder cables.

Pitch trim is by a tab on the right elevator actuated by an electric servo. Roll trim is by a spring bungee system actuated by an electric servo. Pitch and roll trim are selected by a ``Coolie Hat'' switch on the pilot's stick grip. Pitch trim can also be selected by a spring loaded switch ahead of the rear seat throttle lever. Trim positions are shown on LCD indicators located on the upper left portion of the instrument panel. Trim system power can be selected to OFF, FRONT or FRONT + REAR by a three position switch on the right console. Trim system power will also be removed while the red TRIM + WING LEVELER cut-out switch on the pilot's stick is depressed.

Flaps are operated electrically and are controlled by a switch mounted on the left side of the instrument panel.

\section{FUEL SYSTEM} Fuel is stored in two 21.5 US gallon tanks secured to the leading edge structure with screws and plate nuts. Fuel drains are fitted to the lowest point of each tank (and of the fuel system) and should be opened prior to the first flight of the day and after each refuelling to check for sediment and water.

The left tank is fitted with an inverted fuel pickup, which is a weighted length of flexible line, with a fuel pickup at the loose end. This introduces additional failure modes for the left tank --- the fuel pickup could get hung up inside the tank, or it could become disconnected at the front end. These failures would increase the amount of unusable fuel in the left tank by several gallons.
\begin{Note}
[WARNING] Never assume that all fuel in the left tank is usable. The left tank must not be selected for takeoff or landing unless there are at least \textcolor{red}{10 USG} of fuel remaining in that tank. If it is planned to use most of the fuel on a flight, the left tank must be used to a low value while adequate fuel still remains in the right fuel tank to safely land the aircraft in case the left fuel tank feed ceases prematurely.
\end{Note}

The fuel selector valve is located to the left of the pilot's seat on the lower console. A knob on the valve handle must be lifted to change the selection to or from the OFF position.

A fuel gascolator is located in the left wing root area. This is not the lowest point in the fuel system and is intended as a dirt trap only prior to fuel entering the fuel pumps. The gascolator should be drained prior to the first flight of the day --- the fuel selector must be selected to LEFT or RIGHT to allow fuel to flow through the gascolator so it can be drained.

An electric boost pump is fitted in case of failure of the engine-driven fuel pump and is also used during takeoff and landing. The boost pump is controlled by the green ON/OFF toggle push button on the pilot's control stick. The green boost pump lamp on the upper left instrument panel will illuminate when electrical power is supplied to the boost pump.

The fuel filter is located on the engine side of the firewall, and is in the system between the boost pump and the engine-driven fuel pump.

A fuel flow transducer is fitted between the engine-driven fuel pump and the fuel injection servo. The fuel flow information is fed to the Grand Rapids EIS 4000, which has a detotalizer function that calculates predicted fuel remaining. The fuel quantity information in the EIS 4000 must be updated whenever fuel is added to or drained from the fuel tanks.
\begin{Note}[WARNING]The displayed fuel remaining value does not take into account any possible fuel leaks, or erroneous input of starting fuel quantity.
\end{Note}

A fuel pressure transducer is mounted between the engine-driven fuel pump and the fuel injection servo. The fuel pressure is monitored and alarmed by the Grand Rapids EIS 4000.

\end{wrapfigure}

The electrical system includes a 14 volt 60 amp Main Alternator, a 12 volt, 17 amp-hour battery, over voltage protection, an 8 amp Standby Alternator and a Battery Contactor. Power is distributed to Main, Essential and Battery Buses. Normally the Main Bus is powered from the Battery and Main Alternator, and the Essential Bus is powered from the Main Bus via a diode. The Battery Bus is powered all the time, regardless of the state of the Battery Contactor. The Essential Bus has a selectable alternate feed path from the Battery Bus. This alternate feed path is used if the power supplied from the Main Bus has failed, or if the Main Bus is manually shed following Main Alternator failure. An Aux Power outlet located on the lower aft face of the right landing gear box provides 10A of Battery Bus power for hand held devices. It may also be used to charge the battery, providing that the charge current is limited to less than 10A.

\end{figure}

\textbf{Electrical System Switches} --- Electrical system switches are positioned on the right switch console. The master relay and the Main Alternator are controlled by the same three-position switch. The switch positions are OFF, BATT and BATT+ALT. The Standby Alternator can supply power to the Battery Bus, and the Essential Bus even if the BATT/ALT switch is selected to OFF.

\textbf{Over Voltage Protection} --- Each alternator has independent over voltage protection. If the alternator output voltage is too high, the over voltage protection system will short the Main Alternator field or the Standby Alternator relay to ground. This will open a CB on the aft end of the right side switch console, and shutdown the affected alternator. The over voltage protection may be reset by pushing the CB back in, but it will pop again if the over voltage condition still exists.

\textbf{Electrical System Circuit Protection} --- All circuit protection is by fuses, except for circuit breakers for the Main Alternator Field and the Standby Alternator Relay. The fuses for the Main and Essential busses are mounted on the aft face of the hinged door on the forward baggage compartment aft bulkhead, and are accessible on the ground only. Battery Bus fuses are in a fuse block next to the battery, behind the aft baggage compartment. Fusible links are also used to protect some of the wires.

\section{COCKPIT LIGHTING}

\textbf{PANEL FLOOD LIGHTS} --- The main instrument panel lighting is provided by two white LED flood lights, one mounted on the front end of each canopy sill. The flood lights are powered from the Essential Bus, and are controlled by the left-most dimmer knob on the lower left part of the main instrument panel, labelled ``INST PANEL''.

\textbf{GOOSE-NECK FLOOD LIGHT} --- Map lighting and emergency instrument panel lighting is provided by a goose-neck lamp mounted on the right wall of the front cockpit, powered from the Essential Bus. It is controlled by a dimmer knob fitted next to the base of the lamp. The goose-neck may be removed from the socket by pressing the release button next to the base.

\textbf{760 COM DISPLAY} --- The display back-lighting for the Microair 760 COM is controlled by the INST PANEL dimmer knob. The display back-lighting is powered even if the 760 COM is unpowered.

\textbf{GARMIN GNS 430W \& GTX 327} --- The display and key back-lighting for the Garmin GNS 430W GPS and GTX 327 Transponder are controlled by the middle dimmer knob, labelled ``AVIONICS''. The display intensity is controlled by an ambient light sensor if the dimmer knob is rotated fully counter clock-wise --- this allows the display intensity to increase as required in bright sunlit conditions.

\textbf{ENGINE INSTRUMENTS \& CDI} --- The analog tachometer, manifold pressure, fuel gauges and CDI are internally lit --- these lights are powered from the Main Bus. The light intensity is controlled by the right-most dimmer knob, labelled ``CDI + ENG INST''.

\section{EXTERNAL LIGHTING}

\textbf{Landing Light} --- The Landing Light is installed in the right outboard wing. It is powered from the Main Bus and uses a 55 amp halogen automotive bulb. The switch is on the left side of the instrument panel.

\textbf{Taxi Light} --- The Taxi Light is installed in the left outboard wing, and is identical to the landing light, except it is aimed at a lower angle. It is powered from the Main Bus, and its switch is on the left side of the instrument panel.

\textbf{Flash Function} --- The Landing and Taxi Lights also have a ``wig-wag'' flash function which flashes the two lights alternately. It is selected by placing both the Landing and Taxi Light switches in the middle, ``FLASH'' position.

\textbf{Position Lights }- The aircraft is fitted with red, green and white position lights in the left wing tip, right wing tip and rudder bottom respectively. The wing tip position lights are mounted under flush covers in the forward edge of the wing tips. The rudder bottom light is in the centre of a concentric position light/strobe light assembly. The position lights are powered from the Main Bus, and the switch is located on the left side of the instrument panel. The switch has three positions: ``OFF'', ``NAV'', and ``NAV + STR''. The position lights are ON if the switch is in either of the latter two positions.

\textbf{Strobe Lights} --- The aircraft is fitted with white strobe lights, with strobe tubes under flush covers on each wing tip and on the aft end of the rudder bottom fairing. The strobe lights are powered from the Main Bus, and the switch is located on the left side of the instrument panel. The switch has three positions: ``OFF'', ``NAV'', and ``NAV + STR''. The strobe lights are ON only if the switch is in the ``NAV + STR'' positions.

\section{PITOT-STATIC SYSTEM}

The pitot system provides pitot pressure to the EFIS and the airspeed indicator. The heated pitot tube is located under the left wing, about two thirds of the way along the span. The pitot heat, powered from the Main Bus, is controlled by the PITOT HEAT switch on the right hand console.

The static system supplies static pressure to the EFIS, airspeed indicator, altimeter, vertical speed indicator and altitude encoder (which provides altitude information to the transponder). The static pressure ports are on the rear sides of the fuselage and are positioned to self drain. An alternate static port is located near the bottom of the right landing gear box in the cockpit. The alternate static port is a locking valve which is spring loaded closed. It can be pushed upwards and turned to lock it in the open position. Airspeed and altitude corrections must be applied if the alternate static port is open.

\section{HEATING AND VENTILATION}

Cabin heat is provided via two heat muffs attached to the exhaust system and fed with high pressure air taken from the baffling behind \#3 cylinder and ahead of \#1 cylinder. The heated air is ducted through the firewall in two locations: ahead of the rudder pedals, and on the rear wall of the front baggage compartment lower extension, near the right landing gear box. The heat is controlled by two push/pull cables just below the right heat outlet. The right heat outlet is from an orientable eyeball vent that may be pointed to blow the hot air past the right side of the pilot towards the passenger.

Ventilation air is supplied from two NACA inlets: one on the front left side of the fuselage for the pilot, and one under the right wing for the passenger. The pilot's ventilation air is fed to an eyeball vent under the left side of the instrument panel. The passenger's ventilation air is fed to an eyeball vent just aft of the front seat back.

A Defog Fan is mounted beneath a grill on the glare shield. It is controlled by a switch on the right console, and blows air from under the instrument panel against the windscreen.

An Aerox 13 cubic ft, 2015 psi removable oxygen cylinder (D size cylinder) is fitted in the deep well on the right side of the forward baggage compartment. The bottle and mounting bracket may be removed when not required. A pressure gauge, ON-OFF valve and pressure regulator is installed on top of the cylinder. Two oxygen lines are connected to the regulator with quick disconnect fittings. A slide on sleeve protects the pressure regulator and valve.

The oxygen supply hoses are permanently mounted in the aircraft. Quick disconnects on the front end of the hoses allow them to be disconnected from the regulator when the bottle is removed. Quick disconnects on the aft end of the hoses allow the flow meters and cannulas to be removed. Each end of the oxygen supply lines should be capped when disconnected, and the lines should be stowed in the clips provided. The maximum altitude at which the Aerox Oxysaver cannulas may be used is 18,000 ft.

\piccaption{Dynon D-10A EFIS}
\parpic[r]{\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{../Diagrams/d10a_new_format}}

The Dynon D-10A EFIS provides attitude, heading, airspeed, altitude, vertical acceleration and slip ball information on a 4" colour LCD display.

\textbf{Operator Interface} --- The six buttons along the bottom of the bezel provide access to various functions. After a button is pushed, labels are displayed above each button. The far-right button will always command a return to the previous menu.

\textbf{Power} --- The EFIS is normally powered from the Main Bus. The unit may be turned ON by pressing the far-left button. If Main Bus power is lost, the unit will automatically transition to its internal battery for 30 seconds, then shutdown. A screen message will be displayed, warning of the impending shutdown. This automatic shutdown may be cancelled by pressing the far-left button.

If Main Bus power is lost, but aircraft battery power is still available, the EFIS BU switch on the right console may be selected to provide EFIS power from the Battery Bus.

If any power source is lost, an on-screen voltmeter display will appear, showing the voltage levels of the EFIS main power, emergency power and internal battery.

The unit may be turned OFF by pressing the holding the POWER button, which is the far-left button on the Main Menu.

\textbf{Attitude} --- The EFIS uses solid-state accelerometers and rate gyros to determine the attitude. Airspeed data is used to provide acceleration corrections, so the attitude info may be in error during manoeuvring if the pitot or static lines are blocked. The attitude information may become invalid for short periods following extreme manoeuvres (e.g. aerobatics or spins). The colours of the attitude display will be changed from the normal blue/brown to shades of grey if the EFIS detects that the displayed attitude may not be valid.

\textbf{Heading} --- The heading is sensed by a remote flux valve mounted in the rear fuselage. The flux valve may be affected by the steel canopy frame when the canopy is open. It is possible that EMI from the flux valve may be heard on the COM. The flux valve may be disabled by selecting the ``FLUX VALVE'' switch OFF on the upper left side of the instrument panel. If the flux valve is disabled, the unit will use an internal flux valve, but it has very large errors, so the heading info will be essentially meaningless.

\textbf{Altimeter Setting} --- The altimeter setting can be viewed or changed via the BARO selection from the Main Menu.

\textbf{Bugs} --- Airspeed, altitude and heading bugs may be set via the BUGS selection from the Main Menu.

\textbf{Dimmer} --- Screen intensity can be set via the DIM selection on the Main Menu 2 page {[}Main Menu $\Rightarrow$ MORE $\Rightarrow$ DIM{]}.

\textbf{Optional Display Items} --- The CLUTTR menu item allows the user to select which items are displayed {[}Main Menu $\Rightarrow$ MORE $\Rightarrow$ SETUP $\Rightarrow$ CLUTTR{]}. For example, the airspeed vertical tape and digital readouts may be independently selected, if desired.

The INFO menu controls optional VSI, voltmeter and accelerometer displays {[}Main Menu $\Rightarrow$ MORE $\Rightarrow$ INFO $\Rightarrow$ LEFT (or RIGHT, as desired){]}.

Information on the following additional, optional functions may be found in the EFIS Pilot's User Guide:

\begin{itemize*}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{../Diagrams/gns430_1}
\end{center}
\caption{Garmin GNS 430W}
\end{figure}

This section will only provide info on basic functions required for VFR flight. See the Garmin GNS 430W Pilot's Guide and Reference for more detailed information, and coverage of IFR related functions. Some aspects of the functionality are configurable via configuration menus (see Pilot's Guide for details).

The GNS 430W System is a fully integrated, panel mounted instrument, which contains a VHF Communications Transceiver, a VOR/ILS receiver, and a Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) Global Positioning System (GPS) Navigation computer. The system consists of a GPS antenna, GPS Receiver, VHF VOR/LOC/GS antenna, VOR/ILS receiver, VHF COMM antenna and a VHF Communications Transceiver.

Provided the Garmin GNS 430W's GPS receiver is receiving adequate usable signals, it has been demonstrated capable of and has been shown to meet the accuracy specifications for:
\begin{enumerate}
\item VFR/IFR enroute, terminal, and non-precision instrument approach (GPS, VOR, VOR-DME, NDB, NDB-DME, RNAV) operation using WGS-84 (or NAD 83) coordinate reference datum in accordance with AC 20-138. \textcolor{red}{Add WAAS info.}
\item The system meets RNP5 airspace (BRNAV) requirements of AC 90-96 and in accordance with AC 20-138, and JAA GAI-20 ACJ 20X4, provided it is receiving usable navigation information from the GPS receiver.
\item The equipment as installed has been found to comply with the requirements for GPS primary means of navigation in oceanic and remote airspace, when used in conjunction with the 400 Series Trainer Program incorporating the FDE Prediction Program. This does not constitute an operational approval.
\end{enumerate}
Navigation is accomplished using the WGS-84 (NAD-83) coordinate reference datum. Navigation data is based upon use of only the Global Positioning System (GPS) operated by the United States of America.

The GNS 430W provides GPS, COM, VOR, LOC and G/S capability with a colour moving map display. The COM is connected to the COM 1 on the audio panel. The CDI may display either GPS, VOR or ILS info.

\textbf{Power} --- The GNS 430W is powered from the Essential Bus. The unit is turned ON/OFF by turning the COM PWR/VOL switch at the top left corner. The Self-Test page data must be verified for IFR navigation using the GPS.

\textbf{COM} --- The GNS 430W COM is connected to the COM1 selection of the Audio Panel. The COM volume is controlled by the PWR/VOL knob at the top left corner. This knob is pushed to toggle the squelch ON/OFF. Two concentric tuning knobs at the lower left select the standby frequency for the COM and NAV. The frequency tuning function will default to COM, but it may be toggled between the COM and NAV functions by pushing the inner tuning knob (marked ``PUSH C/V''). The standby and active frequencies are exchanged by pushing the ``C$\updownarrow$'' button. Press and hold the ``C$\updownarrow$'' button to switch to 121.5 mHz.

\textbf{NAV} --- The frequencies are tuned as described in the COM section. The NAV audio may be selected via the audio panel. The NAV volume is controlled by the lower of the two VOL knobs (marked ``V''). The NAV idents are not fed to the NAV audio by default, but they may be selected by pushing the NAV volume knob.

\textbf{CDI} --- the external CDI nav source is selected to either GPS or NAV by the CDI button on the bottom bezel. The current CDI nav source is indicated above the CDI button and by a lit indication on the CDI itself. If GPS is the nav source, the CDI scaling is indicated above the CDI button (see Table \ref{cdi} below).

\begin{Note}
