\section{WING LEVELER} 

The Navaid Devices AP-1 Wing Leveler may be operated in Turn Coordinator mode or Wing Leveler mode. A horizontal red LED display indicates turn rate. In Wing Leveler mode, wing leveler and GPS tracking modes are available. The WING LVLR switch on the LH console controls power to the wing leveler system. The power to the servo may be temporarily interrupted by pressing and holding the red master disconnect switch on the pilot's control stick. There is a clutch in the system that will slip to allow the pilot to override the wing leveler if required. %As a last resort, there is a removable pin where the wing leveler push rod connects to the base of the pilot's control stick. 

\subsection*{Controls}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.5\linewidth}p{0.5\linewidth}}
\begin{minipage}[b]{\linewidth}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{TK$\bullet$TC$\bullet$WL} --- Selects the mode of operation --- Track (TK), Turn Coordinator (TC), or Wing Leveler (WL). In Track mode, the unit tracks the GPS or NAV/LOC signal from the GNS 430, whichever is selected as the GNS 430W CDI source. In Turn Coordinator Mode, the unit is not connected to the flight controls, and simply serves as a back-up Turn Coordinator. In Wing Leveler mode, the unit provides aileron inputs to maintain zero yaw rate, or to turn, as controlled by the Turn knob. 
\item \textbf{TRIM} --- Adjusts the reference from the built-in yaw gyro. Used if the wings are not level when the Turn knob is in the centre detent. 
\item \textbf{TURN} --- Commands turns when the unit is in Wing Leveler mode. 
\item \textbf{TRIM POTS} --- Used to set the gains during flight testing. Should not be adjusted except as part of a dedicated flight test program.

\subsection*{Indicators} 
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{4} 
\item \textbf{TURN RATE} --- Bar of red LEDs illuminate to indicate turn rate. The centre LED is illuminated at zero turn rate. The bar extends from the centre to indicate the magnitude and direction of the turn rate. 
\item \textbf{STANDARD TURN MARKERS} --- Triangles above the turn rate bar indicate a 3 deg/second turn rate. 
\item \textbf{SLIP BALL} --- Indicates lateral acceleration. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Power}

\textbf{MAIN POWER} --- The Wing Leveler power is controlled by the WING LVLR switch on the right switch console. The unit is powered from the Main Bus.

\textbf{SERVO DISENGAGE} --- The servo power supply may be interrupted by pressing and holding the red TRIM/WING LEVELER disable switch on the front stick grip. %If required, the linkage between the servo and the stick may be disconnected by pulling the ``Pip'' pin that is located at the bottom of the front stick, just above the fore and aft pivot.
